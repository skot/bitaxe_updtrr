# updtrr - Bitaxe Firmware and Web Interface Updater

A Python script to update ESP-Miner firmware and web interface files on multiple Bitaxe devices simultaneously. Includes both command-line and beautiful TUI (Text User Interface) versions.

## Features

- Updates multiple Bitaxe devices from a CSV file of IP addresses
- Uploads ESP-Miner firmware via `/api/system/OTA` endpoint
- Uploads web interface files via `/api/system/OTAWWW` endpoint
- **Beautiful TUI (Text User Interface)** with real-time status updates
- Comprehensive logging with both console and file output
- Configurable timeouts and delays
- Progress tracking and detailed error reporting
- Supports both simple IP list and CSV formats

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `requests` library

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Make the script executable (optional):
```bash
chmod +x updtrr.py
```

## Usage

### TUI (Text User Interface) - Recommended

For a beautiful real-time interface with live status updates:

```bash
python updtrr_tui.py devices.csv esp-miner.bin www.bin
```

### Command Line Interface

For traditional command-line operation:

```bash
python updtrr.py devices.csv esp-miner.bin www.bin
```

### Advanced Usage with Options

Both versions support the same options:

```bash
python updtrr_tui.py --timeout 120 --device-delay 15 --upload-delay 10 devices.csv firmware.bin web.bin
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `csv_file`: Path to CSV file containing IP addresses
- `esp_miner_bin`: Path to the ESP-Miner firmware binary file
- `www_bin`: Path to the web interface binary file

### Optional Arguments

- `--timeout`: HTTP request timeout in seconds (default: 60)
- `--device-delay`: Delay between device updates in seconds (default: 10)
- `--upload-delay`: Delay between web interface and firmware uploads in seconds (default: 5)

## TUI Features

The TUI version (`updtrr_tui.py`) provides:

- **Real-time status display** with colored indicators
- **Live progress tracking** showing current device and overall progress
- **Upload progress bars** for each image (WWW and firmware) with percentage and byte counts
- **Device status grid** with visual symbols:
  - ‚è≥ Pending
  - üì§ Uploading web interface
  - ‚ö° Uploading firmware
  - ‚úì Success
  - ‚úó Failed
  - üéâ Completed
- **Activity log** showing recent events and messages
- **Statistics panel** with success/failure counts and elapsed time
- **Interactive controls** (press 'q' to quit, 'r' to refresh)

## CSV File Format

The script supports two formats for the IP address file:

### Simple List Format
```
192.168.1.100
192.168.1.101
192.168.1.102
```

### CSV Format
```csv
IP,Device Name,Notes
192.168.1.100,Bitaxe-001,Main device
192.168.1.101,Bitaxe-002,Test device
192.168.1.102,Bitaxe-003,Spare device
```

**Note**: When using CSV format, only the first column (IP addresses) is used. Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored.

## Process Flow

For each device, the script:

1. **Uploads web interface** to `/api/system/OTAWWW`
2. **Waits** (configurable delay) 
3. **Uploads ESP-Miner firmware** to `/api/system/OTA`
4. **Waits** before proceeding to next device (configurable delay)

## Logging

The script provides detailed logging:

- **Console output**: Real-time progress and status updates
- **Log file**: Complete log saved to `updtrr.log`
- **Status indicators**: 
  - ‚úì Success
  - ‚úó Failure  
  - ‚ö† Partial success

## Error Handling

The script handles various error conditions:

- **Network timeouts**: Configurable timeout for HTTP requests
- **Connection errors**: Device unreachable or network issues
- **Authorization errors**: HTTP 401 responses (device access restrictions)
- **File errors**: Missing or unreadable binary files
- **Invalid responses**: Non-200 HTTP status codes

## Examples

### Update 3 devices with TUI (recommended):
```bash
python updtrr_tui.py my_devices.csv esp-miner-v2.1.0.bin www-v2.1.0.bin
```

### Update 3 devices with command line:
```bash
python updtrr.py my_devices.csv esp-miner-v2.1.0.bin www-v2.1.0.bin
```

### Update with longer timeouts for slow networks:
```bash
python updtrr_tui.py --timeout 180 --device-delay 20 devices.csv firmware.bin web.bin
```

### Quick update with minimal delays:
```bash
python updtrr_tui.py --device-delay 3 --upload-delay 2 devices.csv firmware.bin web.bin
```

## Exit Codes

- `0`: All devices updated successfully
- `1`: Some devices failed to update completely
- `130`: Interrupted by user (Ctrl+C)
- Other: Script error or all devices failed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection error"**: 
   - Verify device IP addresses are correct
   - Ensure devices are powered on and connected to network
   - Check network connectivity from script host

2. **"Unauthorized access"**:
   - Verify the script host is in the allowed network range for the devices
   - Check Bitaxe device network access settings

3. **"Timeout"**:
   - Increase timeout with `--timeout` option
   - Check network stability and speed
   - Verify devices are responsive

4. **"Invalid firmware file"**:
   - Ensure binary files exist and are readable
   - Verify file paths are correct
   - Check file permissions

### Log Analysis

Check `updtrr.log` for detailed information about:
- Which devices succeeded/failed
- Specific error messages
- Upload progress and timing
- File sizes and transfer details

## Security Notes

- The script sends binary data over HTTP (not HTTPS)
- Ensure you're on a trusted network when running updates
- Verify binary file integrity before running mass updates
- Consider testing on a single device before batch updates
